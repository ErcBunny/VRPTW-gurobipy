## Rubric

* Model innovation
* Model description
* Small scale verification:
    * create relatively simple test data sets for which you know what the outcome of the model should be
    * all elements need to be tested
* Large scenario:
    * Create a large scenario, in which you change the data set in such a way that the outcome (should) change along a range of values.
    * Think about how you can present your results.
* Result analysis: use graphs
* Readability
* conclusion (include usability and limitations of the model)
